# MyCompiler
Java program designed to create NFA, DFA and context free grammars, allowing to perform lexical and syntactic analysis.
- NFA's are created by using Thompson's construction algorithm
- Available operations on NFAâ€™s are: creation of a basic automata, join, concatenate, positive closure, Kleene closure, creation by RegEx, conversion to deterministic, etc.
- Grammar operations are: LL(1), LR(0), LALR(1), LR(1). The operations show the table generation and string parsing
